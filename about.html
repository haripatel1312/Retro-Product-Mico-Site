                <p>Volkswagen AG, a German automaker now controlled by Porsche SE, formed Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. as a French-registered, wholly-owned subsidiary on December 22, 1998. On the same day, the company purchased the design and branding rights to Bugatti from Italian industrialist Romano Artioli, who constructed supercars in Italy with Bugatti SpA between 1987 and 1998. Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S., still abbreviated to Bugatti, has been the official name of the Bugatti automotive brand since 2000. Since that time, the company's headquarters have been relocated to Molsheim, France.
                    Volkswagen officially founded Bugatti Automobiles S.A.S. on December 22, 2000, with former VW drivetrain chief Karl-Heinz Neumann as president. The 1856 Château Saint-Jean, once Ettore Bugatti's guest residence, was purchased by the business.We purchased a house in Dorlisheim, near Molsheim, and began restoring it to use as the company's headquarters. The original factory was still in the hands of Snecma, who were adamant about keeping it. VW declared in August 2000 at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance that they will instead establish a new modern atelier (factory) next to and south of the château. The atelier was officially opened on September 3, 2005.
                    Volkswagen revealed in September 2020 that it was planning to sell its Bugatti automotive brand, and negotiations with the Croatian company Rimac Automobili commenced. Around 700 Bugatti vehicles have been sold since 2005 but Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess considered the unprofitable brand as ballast.</p>

This mode must be enabled with the top speed key before driving. The steering is restricted, and the car is lowered even further.
